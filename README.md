Currently (17/07/2016) This project is in the developing phase, more specifically an alpha version is available. 

ProximityMarket is an Android application that provides a service to find in the proximity some advertisements.
The Android application exploits the GPS device in order to find the "near" advertisements.
This repository has the source code front-end side and it is written in Java object oriented language.

The back-end side of this application is at this link: https://github.com/PP90/MaPS-Project-Server-Side-.

How does ProximityMarket work?
The user, in first place, must be registered to the application in order to interact with it.
Then, he\she can insert its own advertisements. 

The advertisement is a sort of announce published on a wall. It can be one of these types:
  - buy:  the user decides to buy something
  - sell: the user decides to sell something
  - donate: the user decides to donate (freely) something
  - exchange: the user decides to exchange something

Of course is possible to attach a photo with the advertisement.

On the other hand, the user can find the "near" advertisements.
The "nearness" depends on within how many meters the user decides to find the advertisements.
So, he\she can decide, for instance, to find the "buy" advertisement within 1000 meters. 
The application will show the "near" advertisements.
